# AWS Transcribe Example with SST

Hi, my name is Özgür and I have made this example repository to showcase a small part of a project I made for myself.

If you like to see a demo, I published a video presenting of this example on my Socials (~~[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/)~~ (will be added soon), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9pPliORZnjI)).

## Requirments to run this example project

- You need to have an AWS account and have to setup the AWS CLI. [Here is a Guide](https://sst.dev/chapters/create-an-aws-account.html) on how to create an AWS account, setting up the IAM user and configuring the AWS CLI.
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as the package manager

## How to use this example

Here are the commands to run this project:

- Run as Dev

```bash
pnpm sst dev
```

- To run the Frontend Package

```bash
cd packages/frontend && pnpm dev
```

- Deploy to production

```bash
pnpm sst deploy --stage production
```
